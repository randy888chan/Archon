# Pull Request  Fix Linux Docker Networking and Add Flexible Port Configuration

## Summary
<!-- Provide a brief description of what this PR accomplishes -->
This PR addresses critical deployment issues on Linux systems and adds flexible port configuration to avoid conflicts with existing services. These changes will help users successfully deploy Archon alongside other applications like Supabase projects and development servers.

## Problems Solved

### 1. üêõ Docker Network Connectivity Issues on Linux
**Problem:** Containers couldn't reach host services through `host.docker.internal` on Linux systems, causing Supabase connection timeouts.

**Solution:** 
- Use `host-gateway` instead of hardcoded IPs for better cross-platform compatibility
- Document network configuration options for different deployment scenarios

### 2. üêõ Port Conflicts with Existing Services
**Problem:** Default ports (3737, 8181, 8051, 8052) often conflict with other development tools.

**Solution:**
- Separate internal (container) ports from external (host) ports
- Use environment variables for flexible external port mapping
- Keep internal ports as defaults for simpler container-to-container communication

### 3. üêõ DOCKER_HOST Environment Conflicts
**Problem:** Systems with Podman or custom Docker configurations fail due to DOCKER_HOST variable interference.

**Solution:**
- Add startup script that properly handles Docker environment
- Document the need to unset DOCKER_HOST when needed

### 4. üêõ Supabase Network Isolation
**Problem:** When using local Supabase, Archon containers on separate networks cannot communicate with Supabase services.

**Solution:**
- Provide configuration option to join existing Supabase network
- Document both isolated and shared network approaches

## Changes Made
<!-- List the main changes in this PR -->
1.Updated `docker-compose.yml`
2. Created `start_archon.sh`
3. Enhanced `.env.example`
4.Created `DEPLOYMENT_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`


### 1. Updated `docker-compose.yml`
```yaml
# Separated internal and external ports
ports:
  - "${ARCHON_SERVER_PORT:-8181}:8181"  # External can change, internal stays consistent

# Fixed host.docker.internal for Linux
extra_hosts:
  - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"  # Works on all platforms Tested only on ubuntu

# Network configuration options
networks:
  app-network:
    driver: bridge  # Default isolated network
    # OR for Supabase integration:
    # external: true
    # name: supabase_network_name
```

### 2. Created `start_archon.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Handles environment setup and provides clear startup information
unset DOCKER_HOST  # Prevents Podman/custom Docker conflicts
docker compose up --build -d
echo "Access points:"
echo "  Web UI: http://localhost:${ARCHON_UI_PORT:-3737}"
# ... etc
```

### 3. Enhanced `.env.example`
```bash
# Custom port configuration to avoid conflicts
ARCHON_SERVER_PORT=8181  # Change to 9282 if 8181 is in use
ARCHON_MCP_PORT=8051     # Change to 9151 if 8051 is in use
ARCHON_AGENTS_PORT=8052  # Change to 9152 if 8052 is in use
ARCHON_UI_PORT=3737      # Change to 4838 if 3737 is in use

# Network configuration for local Supabase
# For local Supabase: use container name
# SUPABASE_URL=http://supabase_kong:8000
# For remote Supabase: use public URL
# SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
```

### 4. Added Comprehensive Documentation
